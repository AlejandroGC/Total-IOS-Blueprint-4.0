 We are going to build a tip calculator. Let's lay out the infrastructure of it first.
 
 (1) Create 3 variables named in camel case of bill before tax, tax percentage, and number of people.
 
 (2) Assign these variables types: real number, real number, and integer respectively.
 
 (3) Give them some random initial values
 
 (4) Change all values of these variables.
 
 (5) Share your questions or answers below this video. Have fun!
